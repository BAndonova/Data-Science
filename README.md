Introduction
The first dataset contains the information for the world happiness index. The joy scores and rankings utilize information from the Gallup World Survey. The scores are based on answers to the most life evaluation address inquired within the survey. This address, known as the Cantril step, asks respondents to think of a step with the most excellent conceivable life for them being a 10 and the most exceedingly bad conceivable life being a and to rate their claim current lives on that scale. The scores are from broadly agent tests for the a long time 2013-2019 and utilize the Gallup weights to create the gauges agent. in the current project only the last survey results from 2019 are taken inot consideration for the analysis. The columns taking after the bliss score assess the degree to which each of six variables – financial generation, social back, life anticipation, flexibility, nonattendance of debasement, and liberality – contribute to making life assessments higher in each nation than they are in Dystopia, a theoretical nation that has values rise to to the world’s least national midpoints for each of the six variables.
The Happiness Score is a national average of the responses to the main life evaluation question asked in the Gallup World Poll (GWP), which uses the Cantril Ladder.
The Happiness Score is explained by the following factors:
- GDP per capita
- Healthy Life Expectancy
- Social support
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Corruption Perception
The remaining datasets represents the The world by income. The World Bank classifies economies for analytical purposes into four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income. For this purpose it uses gross national income (GNI) per capita data in U.S. dollars, converted from local currency using the World Bank Atlas method, which is applied to smooth exchange rate fluctuations.
Estimates of GNI are obtained from economists in World Bank country units who rely primarily on official data published by the countries; the size of the population is estimated by World Bank demographers from a variety of sources, including the UN’s biennial World Population Prospects.
The data contains information about the current classification by income and historical classification by income in xls format and the Adjusted net national income per capita (current US$) World Bank staff estimates based on sources and methods in World Bank's "The Changing Wealth of Nations: Measuring Sustainable Development in the New Millennium" ( 2011 ).
